# üè° California Housing Cost Prediction
This project focuses on predicting housing costs in California using machine learning. The goal is to provide insights into what factors influence housing prices and to accurately predict house values based on the available data.

### Project Overview
The project aims to predict house prices in California based on various features like:

Median Income
House Age
Population
Proximity to the Ocean
Number of Rooms and more.
Using these features, we build a model to estimate housing costs in different areas of California.

### Features
üìä Data Analysis: Analyze and visualize the distribution of housing prices and their relation to key features.
üß† Model Building: Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict housing prices.
‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing data to improve model performance.
### Tech Stack
Python: For data analysis and model development.
Pandas: For handling and processing data.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

### Project Workflow
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers in the housing dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and explore relationships between features and housing costs.
Feature Engineering: Create new features to improve model accuracy.
Model Training: Train machine learning models to predict housing prices.
Evaluation: Assess the model‚Äôs performance using metrics like RMSE.

### Conclusion
This project successfully predicts California housing costs and offers valuable insights into factors that affect housing prices. It highlights how machine learning can assist in making accurate predictions for real estate markets.
